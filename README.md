# Website Professional Curiosity (built on Kirby CMS)

A personal website around being curious built on the great cms Kirby. This repository only includes the configuration files, layout and assets around the website (not Kirby itself).

## What's the website about?

Being curious lets us discover wonderful things. Things that you do not expect. To document the wonders we discover, we curate this website.
