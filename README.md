# Website Professional Curiosity (built on Kirby CMS)

A personal website around being curious built on the great cms Kirby. This repository only includes the configuration files, layout and assets around the website (not Kirby itself).

## Plan

1. Write down elements I want to have in Kirby taken from the advantages of Wordpress
1. Create content blueprints for this elements
1. Create pages and snippets for the special views
1. Design a general layout and select a color palette
1. Decide what to do with the Podcast / Create a podcast element in Kirby

* Festgelegte Formate für Grafiken (in der Übersichtsleiste)
* Themenliste ist wichtig, Monatsübersicht aber nicht so
* RSS-Feed

## Assets

### Colour palette

Our palette is taken from [a beautiful muzli colors palette](https://colors.muz.li/palette/f9b4ab/fdebd3/264e70/679186/bbd4ce):

* #F9B4AB
